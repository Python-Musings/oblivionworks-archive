This is the local copy of CBash (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cbash/) that's had some minor edits to it for use with Wrye Bash.

This is based off of the v0.5 archive downloaded from the CBash SVN.

CBash need boost installed, and I've only been able to succesfully build a non-crashing version with MSVC++ 2005.
