Patch option reference (added as a spoiler due to length).

[spoiler]
Please note, when I say that it should be checked, that only applies if there are items on the right side as well (except for one patch option which is detailed below).

Alias Mod Names
[list][*]Should you check it? Not normally.
[*]What does it do? If a file has been renamed, it allows patch options that use the original file name to know that it needs to use the new file name instead.
[*]When does the user need it? If for instance, you rename Oscuros_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp to OOO.esp (for whatever reason), you'll need this option so that Bash knows that OOO.esp is really Oscuros_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp.[/list]
Merge Patches
[list][*]Should you check it? Yes. Unless you need it, it won't help you, but it also doesn't hurt to have it active.
[*]What does it do? It copies mods into the Bashed Patch so that they don't have to be active.
[*]When does the user need it? If you're running out of space in your load order (Oblivion can only handle 255 mods at a time) this can merge some mods into the Bashed Patch so that you have more space. Some mods have to be merged to work properly (filter mods, Item Interchange), but this should be noted in the mod's readme.
[*]When does a modder need it? If you're creating a filter or item interchange type mod. See the readme for details.[/list]
Replace Form IDs
[list][*]Should you check it? No. This is an advanced option. If you need it, you'll know it (or be instructed to use it).
[*]What does it do? It replaces a set of formIDs with another set of formIDs defined by a csv file.
[*]When does the user need it? If you want to replace all usage of one item for another. For instance, P1DCandles replaces all static, non-movable candles with candles that can be picked up, moved around, stolen, etc. It only works for Oblivion.esm though. This option allows P1DCandles to work for all mods (assuming you have the original mod installed).
[*]When does a modder need it? If you're systematically replacing a formID with another, this will do the work for you. It also works across all mods the user has.[/list]
Import Actors
