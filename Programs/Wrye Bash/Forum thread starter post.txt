[b]Overview[/b]:
[list][*]Wrye Bash has a lot of features. I mean a LOT. It's like twenty tools rolled into one. It includes as subfeatures the entire feature sets of other tools, and offers plenty of other features that no other mod tool has. [s]Except installation. It's the "everything but installation" tool![/s] Now with installation too! 
[/list]
[b]Installation[/b]:
[list][*]First time installation is still a little difficult, but later updates are easy (just unzip latest version into Oblivion directory). However, for first time installation you have to preinstall two other packages and then (sometimes) tweak a shortcut. You can't just download and press the pretty buttons -- you have to follow the readme instructions. If you have followed the instructions and still have problems, post the bugdump. If you haven't followed the instructions and whine that it won't work without posting the bugdump, Wrye will bite your fingers off (it's a monkey thing). Otherwise he's quite helpful.
[/list]
[b]Linking[/b]:
[list][*]If you'd like to link to Bash from somewhere else, please do! But be sure to link to either [url="http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368"]TESNexus[/url] or [url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oblivionworks/"]Sourceforge[/url]. Don't link to the actual Bash zip file, since that changes fairly frequently.

You should add a few more things to that list, Wrye. Almost none of the items from my list of the most compelling features in Wrye Bash are on your list:

For everyone:
[list][*]Accurately and quickly managing your load order (correctly sorts ESMs)
[*]Locking your load order (so updated mods automatically load in the exact same spot as the old version)
[*]Checking your load list for problems (missing mod dependencies)
[*]Checking savegames against load list and syncing load list to savegame
[*]Cleaning bloated savegames
[*]Archive Invalidation (now supports BSA-alteration BSA-redirection method)
[*]Replacers (install/remove texture replacement mods -- really any mod, too)
[*]Change master entry in savegame (to avoid losing items, quest progress, etc. when the name of a mod has changed)
[/list]

For mod-makers:
[list][*]Add a master to a plugin (for mod de-isolation)
[*]Change master entry in plugin (for mod de-isolation)
[*]Locking your load order (so changes you make don't move the plugin to the end of your load list)
[*]Savegame profiles (so you can easily test with only your mod active, then easily switch back to playing with all your mods active)
[/list]

[b]Fallout 3[/b]:
[list][*]TheLORDofDOOM has taken on making a FO3 version, Wrye4Fallout3... and here's the first little bit of it (not all translated to account for FO3 but it's showing promise). And another, a bit further along, by Valda called [url="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1079607-relz-garybash/"]garybash[/url].[/list]
[b]Other news[/b]:
[list][*]There is now a listserve for the svn and bug/request/patch/support trackers; if you want to get emails whenever changes to those items happen just join over [url="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oblivionworks-committers"]here[/url]. You can also use it for support requests/questions if you desire.[/list]
