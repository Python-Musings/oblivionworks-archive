;  Bool option (b*****) - use any of:
;	True, 1, Yes, On
;	False, 0, No, Off

;	Relative path, where path is relative to the Oblivion install directory
;		Example=Tools\Tes4Files.exe

[General]
;--sOblivionMods is the Alternate root directory for installers, etc.

;  It is strongly recommended that  you do NOT put it anywhere under the 
;  Oblivion install directory itself,  because Oblivion.exe will  search through
;  every directory under the install directory.
;  This "directory thrashing" can then cause performance problems during gameplay.
;  sOblivionMods is defined specifically to circumvent  this bug by storing files elsewhere.
sOblivionMods=..\Oblivion Mods

;--OblivionPath is the Oblivion directory (containing Oblivion.exe).
;  Use this argument if Bash is located outside of the Oblivion directory.
;  If using a relative path, will be relative to the Mopy directory
;  Example=C:\Games\Oblivion
sOblivionPath=.

;--User directory arguments.
;  These arguments allow you to specify your user directories in several ways.
;  These are only useful if the regular procedure for getting the user directory fails.
;  And even in that case, the user is probably better off installing win32com.

;--UserPath is the user profile path.
;  May help if HOMEDRIVE and/or HOMEPATH are missing from the user's environment.
;  Example=C:\Documents and Settings\Wrye
sUserPath=.

;--PersonalPath is the user's personal directory.
;  Must be used in conjunction with the -l argument.
;  Example=C:\Documents and Settings\Wrye\My Documents
sPersonalPath=.

;--LocalAppDataPath is  the user's local application data directory.
;  Must be used in conjunction with the -p argument.
;  Example=C:\Documents and Settings\Wrye\Local Settings\Application Data
sLocalAppDataPath=.

;  if enabled Bash REQUIRES the Python WinAPI to be installed -- or Bash will not start
