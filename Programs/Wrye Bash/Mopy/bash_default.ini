[General]
;--sOblivionMods is the Alternate root directory for installers, etc. You can
;  use absolute path (c:\Games\Oblivion Mods) or relative path, where path
;  is relative to Oblivion install directory. It is strongly recommended that 
;  you do NOT put it anywhere under the Oblivion install directory itself, 
;  since (due to a bug), Oblivion.exe will at times search through every directory
;  under the install directory. This "directory thrashing" can then cause performance
;  problems during gameplay. sOblivionMods is defined specifically to circumvent 
;  this bug by storing files elsewhere.
sOblivionMods=..\Oblivion Mods
