Added tons of Enchanted arrow ID's/Enchantment ID's  
Ran outta script space(didn't know scripts had a character limit O.o)
    ---Why there are 3 Imbuers now
That's about it only a few more to go plus the final grouping w/ the appartus new home. 

0.99z polished off the Imbue code......then found a better way to do it.... so later version will be MASSIVELY easier to produce

1.5 ermm.....a shhh ton....revamped code COMPLETELY and added tons of functionality for later releases...that's right folks...I'm not done yet!

1.6 New textures for Bone/Hunter/Wooden!!!!! Many, MANY thanks to GristleTL for these!
I also made a few minor bug fixes.  Most notable is a fix/oversight on my part to add the ability to "merge" 20 and 50 arrows at a time.

1.6.3 Many small fixes/changes.  All listed below.
 Fixed an Arrow Merger bug that messed up the amounts used/created
 Changed amts of some arrows created.
 Many minor bug fixes
 Framework built for future balancing adjustments.(More on this coming soon)
 Added Skull to Bone Arrow creation list
 Lowered dmg of Wooden Arrows to 7(1 less then Iron).
 Made Wooden Arrows the failtype for ALL arrows. Now trying to make daedric/hunter at lvl 1 won't  cheese you into ebony/elven arrows.
 Dropped Vamp's Bane effect to 2 sec paralyze.
 Framework built for Crafting Skill integration.
 And of course, the latest creations by Gristle-TL for the arrow/quiver textures.

1.6.4
 Mainly just a coat of polish, I standardized the mesh/texture dirs and added the Golden Arrow  icon.  

1.7
 MANY balance tweaks(Special Thanks to Vincent Wyrmwing there).
 Update to Skill Engine so any skill choice will allow skill gains.
 Addition of Flame Arrow and Bone Arrow of Pain Textures.
 OH!! This is the official release of the Crafting Skill Engine! Basically it allows you to progress in Crafting as you would any other skill.
 That's about all for now..

1.7.1
 Fixed a MAJOR skill gain bug: If Marks/Armorer is your main skill, if this mod caused skill gains you wouldn't get progress towards another level.  I can fix this BUT 1.1beta has the required code to make it work properly.  Until 1.1 final is released by Bethesda Crafting is your only skill to choose from....sorry....
 If you need another Starter Item to change anything Jensines in the Market District will sell you one.  You can also buy 2 items called "1.7.0 Armor/Marksman Fixer", these will subtract one point from the respective skill each time you equip them.  Please only use them to revert any damaged caused by  1.7.0.  I will remove them in the next major update to avoid abuse.
