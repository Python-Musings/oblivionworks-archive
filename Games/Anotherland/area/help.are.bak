0 ARTISTEAL~

Syntax: artisteal <character> <item>

This command allows you to steal one artifact from a player of
ANY status.   This allows you to retrieve artifacts from players
outside your status range.  The artifact is transferred directly
to your inventory, instead of being left on their corpse as is
the case with decapitation.

Note, if you are able to decap a player, you can gain ALL of their
artifacts at once.

0 WEAPONBUY~

Syntax: weaponbuy <number of weapon>

Throughout time men have found ways of strengthening themselves,
from increasing their powers with practice and training, or even
by using the ancient magics.  It has been rumored there was been
the return of the Ancient WeaponsMaster who resides within the
Ancient Dojo.  This mystical place has been known to increase
the power of weapons.  However, it is very difficult to find.
The WeaponsMaster is very cunning and would only allow the best
fighters in the land to attain his craftsmanship.  He has sent out
secret tokens, when combined these tokens create a transporter to
his secret Dojo.

#L***#n This command is for upgrading your weapons.  Once your weapon
level has reached 2000 it is available for upgrade.  Upgrade will
cost 50k qps, then 60k, 70k and so on up to 90k qps.  There are
only 5 upgrade levels available.

For any questions ask Hutoshi.

0 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'

  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
Syntax: cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fireball'       <victim>

~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

-1 ALIAS~

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

0 ARENA~
The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

~

7 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

0 AURAS~
The Necromancy power gives the undead knight acces to powerful auras,
that the knight can enable with the aura command.

level 6  : Bog Aura   (You stand in a permanent swamp, making it hard to flee from you).
level 9  : Fear Aura  (Fighting you makes even the most brave warrior piss their pants).
level 10 : Cloak of Death (Regen boost when your just about to die).

~

0 AUSPEX~
This Discipline is one of extrasensory awareness, empathy and 
perception.  Those using this Discipline tend to be strongly affected by 
environmental phenomena.  Vampires with Auspex are able to see and sense 
things most other people cannot.  Auspex is the opposing Discipline to 
Obfuscate, and they cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rTruesight#n The user can see everything, whether invisible or whatever.
<<*>> #rScry#n Allows you to view the room that the specified target is in.
<<*>> #rReadaura#n Gives you detailed information about a creature or object.
<<*>> #rAstral Walk#n This power allows you to astral to players and mobs.

-1 Apocalypse~
#0APOCALYPSE MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Apocalypse.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if apocalypse is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing apocalypse the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during apocalypse.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
theapocalypse command. ie. 'apocalypse 200' will add 200 qps
to the apocalypse pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on apocalypse). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and apocalypse cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Apocalypse lasts 15 minutes.

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

7 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>

your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.
~

0 BATTLEMAGES MAGE MAGES~
The battlemages are powerful wizards that use their knowledge of the arcane

those they choose. A mage is indeed someone to fear.

Chant      - Use the common spells all battlemages have.
Invoke     - Learn or use some of the more powerful magics.
Magics     - Keep track of what magical affects affects you.
Teleport   - Teleport to any given location.
Objectgate - Summon items from afar.
Truesight  - Enhanced vision.

0 BLINDNESS~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <wand> <target>
Syntax: zap      <wand>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 BREW SCRIBE CARVE ENGRAVE BAKE~
Syntax: cast brew <potion> <spell>
Syntax: cast scribe <scroll> <spell>
Syntax: cast carve <wand> <spell>
Syntax: cast engrave <staff> <spell>

These spells allow other spells to be embedded in the specified object, 
which is usually created via the 'minor creation' spell.
~

Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harrash players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harrash players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harrashment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Okay this is a good command if you kill things that are hard.

Type award and the following will happen.
Takes away 1000 * a number from 1-5 from your mob levels where the higher your generation the 
higher the number goes.
So for example, you have a gen of 2, the value would be 100 * 4.

Resets your Highest Mob level to 0.
Gives you 100 QP +bounus.

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~

0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce ( 1/4th of their exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even crack the skull and eat their brains ;)

This mud has been and will be always based off of, Dystopia 1.2.5 namely called
Dystopia 1.3 Due to the work put into this mud. Unless more work be put into this

of its own because It has not been modified in its original constructs nor has the
way the mud is worked/evaulated/preformed/utilized been edited.

attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to

RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.  If you 
attack while hidden, the surprise attack will inflict one and a half 
times your normal damage (assuming your opponent cannot see you).

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without

armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough

easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.

1 KATANAS~
In the beginning all was chaos and evil reigned supreme across the
lands of Dystopia, the Lords of Light were pushed back to the farthest 
reaches of the universe, their memory almost forgotten.  In their 
darkest hour they hatched a plan to try and restore Law and Order,
looking across the lands they found Sheol a warrior of pure evil, 
looking upon this foul creature they pooled their powers to plant a 
seed of light into his heart.  This seed of light slowly grew 
eventually consuming the darkness and finally a new warrior torn with 
guilt over his previous crimes was born.  The Lords of Light then 
approached Sheol and explained the way to retribution and so was born 
the Church of the Celestial Samurai and its fighting arm known simply 
as the Katanas.
 
Sheol was then tasked with scouring the land looking for other warriors 
to join the fight against the tide of evil.  The task was not an easy 
one, however slowly a small band of Samurai and Angels were found to 
uphold the honour and virtue of the Lords of Light and slowly and order 
began to be returned to the land.
 
As a Katana fighting for the Church of the Celestial Samurai you are 
expected to act accordingly with strength and honour. This will involve 
helping out new souls that have just been born to the land, and seeking 
retribution on those whose foul hearts deserve it, but in order to 
attain these lofty goals only the strongest of pure heart are chosen.
 
Requirements
Class        : Samurai, Angel

0 LICH~
#n #n
Lichs are powerful sorceres that have cheated death by entering a state of
living death. No longer subject to the affects of time, they use their time
to explore other planes and perfect their magic. The lichs grow in power, far
beyond that of most mortal mages, since they have so much more time to perfect
their art. If you thought mages were scary, try fighting a lich that has used
the last 2000 years comming up with nasty spells to kill and destroy.

Masters of conjuring, death, life, necromantics and chaos, lichs have
acces to several powers, some of them are know as :

Conjuring   : Objectgate, Fireball, Planartravel, Golemsummon, Pentagram.
Death       : Readaura, Chillhand, Painwreck, Creeping Doom.
Life        : Regeneration, Earthswallow, Powertransfer, Polarity.
Necromantic : Zombie, Soulsuck, Planarstorm, Planeshift.
Chaos Magic : Chaosmagic, Chaossurge, Chaosshield.

Note : Lichs are a unique class made for Dystopia.

~

Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

7 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

~

1 MASTERY~
When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

~

1 MCCP~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n
 
Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If your client do not support mccp theres another way to use mccp,
the instructions on how to do this can be found on the following
page, and it takes no more than 2-3 minutes to get working.

#Ghttp://www.daimi.au.dk/#-jobo/dystopia/mccp.html#n

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

~

<<*>> #rReina#n This allows you to make the room safe.
<<*>> #rCourage#n You gain extra courage in battle.

~

7 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

MEMORY reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

0 MONKCHI~
A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~
By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.

Lightning Kick - Strikes the opponent with a series of powerful kicks.
Tornado Kick   - Strikes everyone in the room with kicks.
Choyoken       - A devastating attack that targets the opponents stamina.
Raptor Strike  - An attack that syphons the mystical energies of the target.
Nerve Pinch    - A series of attacks targeted at central nerves, paralysing.

sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.

So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Whats Multiplay? And why do I have LIMITED multiplay.
Good Multiplaying-
A player comes on, plays, leaves, comes on another character,
plays, returns to normal character.
Uses a different name, as an alias, to RP differently, have
a feel to the other classes, areas, world.
Limited Multiplay is just that.
Bad Multiplaying-
A player comes on a character, screws another player over by tying
them down, then leaving, going on another character, to decap.
Uses a player as a tank, gets eq, whatever, drops it in a 'secret'
room, then goes on another character to get the eq. I've done this
before and my punishment 'A player twit and then some'.
Thats what illegal multiplaying is, just that.
Consequences-
First time, denied char, trust me, it will happen when you least expect
it.
Second time, a player twit.
Third time, A deletion of character. BOTH.
I've had 5 years of mud experience, not a lot, but enough to know how
and what kind of consequences a person will have.
About the deny of character, Unless you have a good reason, or I feel
that you didn't do it illegally for any reason, ill undeny the character.

Rewards-
If you do catch a player Doing anything under the Bad multiplaying, and
then some, Give me the logs of what happened, a print screen will be best
in JPG format, sent to tommytran99@juno.com, will get that player denied/
twited/wiped with no connection to you.
Your rewards, Another land eq of your choice, or 25k Qps. We do not
condone Bad Multiplaying. I've done it before, I faced the consequences,
now its your turn to feel it when it happens to you.


Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

0 NINJAS~
Ninja's are warriors trained in the dark art of Ninjutsu.  They fight
using stealth and quickness making them a deadly foe.  Ninja's have few, yet
powerful powers at their disposal, and when these powers are mastered a 
ninja can be a most powerful adversary.  Through stealth a ninja can sneak
upon a victim and do a deadly amount of damage, and if this is not enough
they can slink away and hide in the shadows.  However, if you try to run
from a master ninja you shall find yourself hard pressed to make it out
alive.

It is vital for a ninja to focus his or her Ki, this is done with the command
'michi'. A ninja CANNOT regen while not in a state of michi. Ninjas are   
ranked with a system of belts. Each belt adds more punch to the ninjas
abilities in combat, meaning more damage, better dodge, more attacks, etc.
Belts can be trained with the command 'train beltX' where X is the current
belt that the ninja wish to learn.

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Pdox takes your hp/mana/move back down to -10.
Takes 1k qp off you.
IF you don't have 1k qp, 1 generation, if no generations aval, 1 upgrade, if no upgrade
ALL YOUR WEAPONS RESET, So don't fuck with ppl lower then you.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G#y(actually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possibly Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

0 BOTTING~

This is the deal. Botting is not ILLEGAL, NOR ADVISED.
Okay enough of that stupid stuff, This is what LEGAL botting is:
Staying in the proper botting facility denoted by:
Recall D S E = Weapon Training
Recall D S W = Spell Training
Recall D S U E/W Two more Spell Training Rooms.

This is how your qps get calculated:
Every minute -10 qps.
Every minute in the Training Center, IE TRAINING HALL, another -10 qps.
Every punt, -100 qps.

Those are the only two places which you can bot.
You cannot ask for a reimbursment or any kind of 'Refund' If you die, get slayed
or do anything while in these areas. Immortals may not decap, slay twit or in any way
touch you unless otherwise called before-hand. You can be stopped from botting if the
immortals feel that botting is slowing/degrading/dulling down the mud for the specified
amount of time.
This is what ILLEGAL botting is:
Botting somewhere other then stated heren.
Botting BOTH spells and weapons at the same time.
You cannot say/do/bitch about anything that happens to you from or by an immortal.
You cannot ask for ANYTHING if in the position where you get killed/twitied/demoted/decapped/etc
from an Immortal/Player.

Overall, It't not good to bot.

your customised prompts.

0 PROTEAN~
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

<<*>> #rUmbravision#n A combination of truesight shadowsight allows
      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
<<*>> #rFlamehands#n This power erupts your hands into flames.
<<*>> #rEarthmeld#n Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
<<*>> #rClaws#n Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
      claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.

~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.

0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5+(value) QP per +1, max allowed is +250 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30+(value QP's per +1, max allowed is +50 on each.
Ac: 10+(value) QP's per -1, max allowed is -100.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.
For your Customized title like my -=<AyU>=-, it will cost 5k QP.

These are the limits
Normal item -short sword those that you can find-:
600+(upgrade level*100)
Protoplasm -The item you get for typing quest create (type)-:
1000+(upgrade level*100)
Improved item -use the c improve on an item-:
1500+(upgrade level*100)

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and

con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or

the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their

1 AUTOCLASS~

!!!!!!!!!!!!!IS NOT USED ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!

Autoclassing is a way to choose among some of the more powerful classes.
But....
You can stay Base class throughout your upgrades.
This is the process:

He only uses upgrade, never autoclass.
A person wanting the upgraded class:
He uses selfclass, then upgrades, then gets 5kqp and 100million exp,
then autoclass, then uses upgrade from there.
command upgrade. Simple?

You need 5k Qp and 100million exp.

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.

1 WARPS~
All warps are automatic, so you don't need any commands to activate them, just the command
obtain to get new warps. Theres a total of 18 warps, some have an affect, others don't.

These are the possibly warps :

Your body is protected by a indestructable crystal shell.
Your skin is as hard as steel.
Your arms are incredibly strong.
Your legs are incredibly strong.
Your tongue is long and venomous.
Your tail fires deadly spikes during combat.
Your breath is putrid and deadly.
You have incredible speed.
You have increased stamina, reducing the damage you take.
Your heightened senses enable you to hunt people. (*)
You have the ability to devour your opponents, sending them into the pits of Hell. (*)
Your features are so horrid that they may stun those who look at you. (*)
Your body has the ability to regenerate incredibly fast.
Your mounts transform into hideous Demons. (use the mount spell)
You have the power to transform into a deadly battle axe. (*)
Your body is composed of deadly magma.
Your skin is covered with shards of ice.
A pair of leathery wings protrude from your back.

The warps with (*) doesn't have any affect, and some of the warps are
used together with inparts or disciplines, most are just extra attacks
in combat or extra toughnes.

Maybe some day when I have some spare time, I'll clean up the demon powers,
but currently you'll just have to live with the mess.

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

1 WHO~
Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

Enjoy!

0 QUERY NUKEBUF~
As you may know, if you enter a lot of commands (i.e. spamming
berserk, etc), they get put into a buffer.  Well, I've just
created a way to work with that buffer.  These two new commands
are not real commands, and you must fully type them, and ! does
not work.  But they do not care if you have other commands
waiting, or if you have a wait state.  Query will list all of
the commands you have buffered, and Nukebuf will clear them.
If you are not clear on what this does, just spam berserk alot,
then immediately type query.  You will see a list of berserks.
Type nukebuf, then type query again, and they are all gone.
