Mother Ellisiam~
Mother Ellisiam~
Mother Ellisiam stands here, her peaceful face set in a warm smile.
~
This woman radiates a peaceful aura, and you feel safe in her presence.
That is, until you reveal your demonic and evil nature, at which time 
she will BANISH YOUR ASS.  Be wary, this woman might be sweet and caring,
but those robes aren't there to hide her figure from view.

#0Andriel#n~
The Governess, Andriel, stands here in a crisp dress suit.
~
Her hair is twisted into a tight knot at the back of her head, held in 
place with a few rather sharp looking pins.  A starched white handkerchief 
pokes out of her left breast pocket, but you can see the smallest smudge of 
blood on the edge.  This woman has a strange gleam to her eye, like she 
has done something very, very wrong.

Flora is dressed in a eye-catching sundress in a beautiful shade of 
green.  Her simple slip-on shoes look ilke they'd be comfortable to 
walk around in all day long.  Her hands are covered in a pair of 
gardening gloves, so you're pretty sure she growns her own flowers.

Mulan~
A woman stands here, clutching a towel tightly around her naked form.
~
She seems like she just got out of the shower!  Oh my.  A single drop of 
water drips down her neck, and you follow the trail it makes down, past 
her collarbone, edging into the valley between her breasts.  She notices 
you staring (not to mention you're in her room while she's half NAKED) 
and glares at you, asking you to leave in a firm voice.

belt tied around her waist.  She has at her immediate disposal a very heavy

~
The grocer, Miss Sooq, is a lovely lady in her mid-thirties, of some exotic 
decent.  Her dark hair is swept into a soft tie at her nape, with a few 
tendrils falling loose to frame her face.  Her slightly baggy dress hides 
her curves, but the tantalizing display of ankles has your mouth watering.

~
Salma, the chocolate store owner, doesn't look as though she fits through 
her own shop door.  You have the sneaking suspicion that she lives IN the 
store, eating her own wares to survive.  The wrappers stuck unnoticed to 
her face are a testiment to that theory...

Twiggy Ramirez.  Head of Operations and Owner of GFEnt.  This man looks 
down at you, a cold and calculating gleam in his eyes.  His manner of

is awfully dangerous.  She might trip, or... something.

A creepy looking woman in a labcoat stands here, 
~
Her hair is pitch black with a strange sheen to it, as though it's been 
dyed. Her skin looks rather pale, even for someone who works in a window-
less building.  It seems she likes to pile on the mascara and eyeliner, for
her eyes have been outlined in stark contrast to the rest of her face. Her
boots even convey the dark nature of her style, being black, heavy-duty
combat boots, closed on the edges with shining silver buckles.

arms are quite muscular, and the slight wonder at how he manages to 
fit in that one-size-fits-all labcoat.  Either he's of a non-human
class, or, he's taking steroids, for no respectable researcher in this
company would have that much time to lift weights.

one shimmers and shines in vibrant rainbow-like patterns.  Each tail
feather is thin and flexible, so they resemble streamers, moreso than 
feathers that would assist in flight.

its colors to blend in with its surroundings.  Having a trait like that 
would make for an excellent predator, but this bird uses it to avoid 
being something else's lunch.

~
A low growl issues forth from the rather large canine creature standing 
here.  Chunks of torn flesh remain lodged between long, sharp teeth, as 
though the creature just finished tearing into something.  Unnatural red 
eyes stare at you, unblinking, with a slight manic gleam to them.
Aside from the whole scary-factor, the dog seems to have an extra-soft 
looking coat of fur, perfectly shaped ears and a prize winning body-
structure.  It looks as though this dog was an attempt to create canine
perfection.

This species of dog seems to be practical for burden bearing tasks, similar
to a horse or bull in size, but having a completely canine appearance otherwise.
Its fur is short, seemingly perfect for warmer temperatures, but thick enough 
to provide protection from harsh winds or the occasional drop in temperature.

It's been two years since that fool of a man destroyed our lives.  The town 
is still none-the-wiser, but I can't take it anymore.

Holding such a secret in my hands for so long...  what will happen when they 
find out they've been living a lie?  The bastards watching over us don't seem 
to care that I'm slowly losing my mind, keeping a cheerful face everyday, 
pretending as though nothing is wrong, even though no one is able to leave

Holding such a secret in my hands for so long...  what will happen when they 
find out they've been living a lie?  The bastards watching over us don't seem 
to care that I'm slowly losing my mind, keeping a cheerful face everyday, 
pretending as though nothing is wrong, even though no one is able to leave 
the city limits.  
#n
They've been brainwashed to think a great Goddess saved them all...  
#n
I'll save them.  I'll save them from the lies, I'll save them from themselves.  
#n
They'll thank me for it in the end, I know they will.

Andriel's fountain~
The sound of softly splashing water reaches your ears as you approach the 
center of the square.  The statue of a beautiful woman stands in the middle 
of a glistening pool of water, holding a pitcher that seems to pour endlessly.  
A plaque is at her feet, inscribed with a small amount of text.  A woman sits 
at the edge of the fountain, oblivious to those around her, as she swishes 
her fingers through the cool water.
~

E
plaque~
Destruction rained and destroyed half of our beloved city.  In rememberance 
of those lives lost, and in an offer to please those who watch over us now, 
this fountain has been dedicated to the Goddess Alesyira, a sign of renewing 
life and neverending prosperity.  This plaque has been placed with the wish 
that we shall not meet the same fate as our more violent brothers.  Thus it 
is written, and thus it shall be.    - Andriel,  the Governess
~
E
statue~
A likeness of the Goddess Alesyira, as she was seen once before, walking 
through the city, pouring her warmth and love onto its inhabitants like 
the life-nourishing water that flows from the pitcher.  Fresh flowers have 
been strung into a loop and hung from her neck, and a happy smile graces 
the stone face.

Well, if you would have remembered to bring your ATM card, perhaps you 
could use the machine to withdraw some cash to spend at one of these fine 
establishments.  Oh wait, no, you couldn't, the screen displays 'Out of 
Order'.  What a shame.  There's a small waste bin next to the machine to 
throw your unneeded receipts in, and it looks as though it hasn't been 
emptied yet today.

Thania Way~
You are standing on Thania Way, and close by to the east, there is 
an intersection.  You can hear the sounds of a hammer striking an 
anvil to the south. The sweet scent of flowers fills the air, and 
you have a suspicion there must be a garden or a flowershop nearby.  
The building to the south has a large wooden sign hanging above the 
door, while the shop to the north, a two story building, has its 
logo painted on the its storefront window.

Flora would sell pansies by the dozen.   They're on sale today!   Wow!  
Perhaps you should buy a bouquet and try your luck with that sexy beast 
behind the counter.  You remember hearing somewhere she swings both ways...

hiding her sleeping place from sight.  There is a small door along one wall, 
but it only seems to lead to a bathroom.  No one ever needs a restroom here, 
anyways, because text doesn't pee.

Azumaria Street~
You are standing to the east of a half-open market.  Along the east of
this road you stand on, there is a tall wall surrounding the Governess'
property.  A large number of vines cling to the cracks and crevices in 
the brick, sweeping gracefuls tendrils around the wrought-iron spikes 
lining the top edge.  Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a small
gap in the vines, with no wall behind it.

The Monastery of Mother Ellisiam~
Your gaze is drawn in all directions at once as you enter the silent 
building, for an arching ceiling, rising far higher than it would 
seem from the outside, makes the entire room difficult to see in 
small sections.  Ornate stained-glass windows grace the north wall, 
an open door leads east to a garden of sorts, and to the south of you 
is a secured door.  The sign attached to it reads, 'Living Quarters, 
visitors not permitted.'  Oh well, there goes your dream of seeing a 
nun in the shower.

Monastery Gardens~
It may be in the middle of a bustling city, and next to a popular mall, 
but the monastery gardens are a lovely place to sit and relax.  Birds 
chirp merrily in the trees overhead, and flowers are planted in various 
colors and patterns across the area.  Small paths in the dirt wind 
through the numerous tress.  You can barely see the stone walls of the 
monastery poking slightly above the tops of the trees.

Of course, what kind of woman can LIVE without her chocolate?  The shelves 
are lined with a wide variety of confectionary delights, and you find your 
mouth watering slightly at the sight.  Now, if you aren't going to buy some 
chocolate, it might be a wise idea to FLEE this room immediately.  The 
cashier looks as though she might have devoured someone your size before...

produce, and the back of the shop displays a wide selection of premium 
cuts of meat.  This would be  good place to stock up for a barbeque, 
but you can't remember the last time you actually ATE something aside 
from that pill of stone skin earlier today...

The front foyer of this massive house takes your breath away.  There is 
a dining hall ahead of you, to the east, a library to the north, and the 
staircase leading upstairs has some amazing details carved into the 
bannister.  Perhaps it warrants a closer look when you have more time.  
Two bleached white statues stand in stark contrast to the mahogany doors 
they frame, and artfully arranged bouquets adorn tables lining the walls.

The library is well lit from huge picture windows that look upon a large 
enclosed yard.  Warm light spills from lamps, illuminating the shelves upon 
shelves of books that line the walls.  It looks as though the Governess has 
a taste for science-fiction novels.  A few comfortable looking chairs circle 
a small table, upon which sits a journal of sorts, laying open at the most 
recent entry.  It looks as though the next page has been ripped from the 
binding.

decorated with exquisite sheets and pillows, and it looks ilke it's a

when you go home for the day.  There is a door on the north wall, and 
there is a strange smell lingering around it.

blood, as though it were the tip of a small finger.  How strange.

You are standing inside the Governess' closet.  An unknown number of 
dead bodies lie piled haphazardly against the back wall.  The wall to 
your right has a printed list of names tacked up, and it seems to 
account for every person you've seen in town.  A streak of blood 
serves to mark names off of the list, the number looking to equal 
the amount of corpses currently decaying in the dark.

Katrina's Kiddie Katanas~
As you walk in this store, you find yourself staring at many designs of 
finely crafted katanas, but all about three-fourths the normal length, 
just PERFECT for the child who loves a bit of destruction.  You notice 
the hilts on the blades are also narrower, to make grasping the blade an 
easier feat for small fingers.  While they #iare#n battle-worthy, they're 
rather embarassingly small to tote around as your main weapon.  Perhaps 
you should go find the ADULT katana shop.

The birds that normally annoy the hell out of park visitors are eerily 
silent today.  The slides are still bright and shining in the midday 
sunlight, but as you walk around them to continue on your way, the sight 
of a single bloody handprint catches your eye.  The drying smear is 
roughly the size of a child's, and you're left wondering what happened 
to cause the children to disappear.

Serenity Aviary~
You are standing in the front entrance of a HUGE glass building.  Large, 
iron-looking girders criss cross in some places to stabilize the structure, 
it seems, but it doesn't look as though this place has enough standing 
support.  Soft rays of sunlight filter through the frosted panes of glass, 
and the area is a lot warmer than it was outside.  You suspect they house 
birds from warmer climates.  There is a fine screen mesh surrounding this 
room to prevent the birds' escape.

girders~
You notice the girders don't look too stable.  Perhaps they aren't really
holding up the structure, afterall?  Maybe you should go take a closer look.
~
E
glass~
The glass has been frosted, so you can't really see the sky above.
~
E
frosted~
The glass is frosted, meaning it has been modified slightly to provide
an opacity to not allow people to look in or out, but to allow light to 
filter through and warm the area, as well as nourish the vegetaion.

Saint Christine's School for Girls~
The stone steps leading into this school are well worn by the passing of 
thousands of students, and are currently occupied by numerous young girls 
in adorable school uniforms.  The trees sway side to side in a breeze, as 
though showing their disapproval of your staring.  The front windows to 
the school are made of rippled, distorted glass, preventing people from 
spying on the activities inside.  A large stone wall surrounds the school
yards, and it looks as though it connects to the monastery next door.

Serenity Aviary~
Above you, you can see towering trees and other plantlife wrapping around
itself and neighboring plants, giving this artificial habitat a warm, 
natural feel.  A breeze created by ventilation systems adds to the effect,
and you find it easy to imagine you're still outside.

Azumaria Street~
A small hill is to the west.  The grass is thick on the hillside, 
but you notice a small gap in the grass that seems to be a hole 
in the ground.  To the east, you can see a tall stone wall, topped
with strangely colored poles.

The gap becomes more visible as you draw closer to it, and it 
looks as though it is an animal den of sorts.  The grass has been
slightly crushed near the edge, as though someone, or something, 
big has been there recently.

The poles on the top of the wall are kind of strange-looking, as
you'd normally see wrought iron spikes, or some other form of
decorative counter-measures to intruders climbing over the tall
barrier.  Maybe it's a new form of technology designed better to
keep people out.

A small pathway~
A small pathway follows the wall surrounding the Governess' estate.  It 
seems to lead into the darkness, and occasionally, strange noises can be 
heard from its depths.  Most children refrain from trekking down this 
passageway, for the bedtime stories their mothers tell them about things 
that go bump in the night would only be reinforced by the shadows of the
monsters lurking within.

A narrow door is here, sitting flush with the wall surrounding the estate, 
cleverly hidden from view.  As you reach out to tough the handle, the door 
slides open with a soft whoosh, and you find yourself looking in at a 
hallway.  You turn to look back the way you came, and notice no one nearby.

This hallway runs a short distance to the west before branching off into 
a 'T' running north-south.  Pipes line the right side of the ceiling above 
you, and you can hear the soft whoosh of water running through them, along 
with a quiet humming noise, which you presume is electric currents surging 
through the lines.  On the northern wall, there is a large display of
blinking lights and gauges, each of which seem to monitor various levels
and values.

It seems that the water source is from the north, while the power source 
is to the south, from the way the lines connect and split.  The hallway 
here goes beyond your sight to the north and south, and to the east is
the elevator to other levels in the compound.

Car magazines take up most of the bookshelf.  A lot of the models you 
can't recognize, for they seem to be very old editions.  A calendar is 
hung above the bed, displaying antique car designs.  An old toolbox 
sits on the bookshelf next to the magazines, the lid propped open.

gfent~
GFEnt, the corportation running this extensive study, is dedicated to 
finding out our true nature, and the effects of diety and other random
elements inserted into our everyday lives.  Many projects are curerntly
being conducted, from the living-toy run mall complex, to the all-female
society linked with it.  The Dieties in plave are artificial creations
of our Deit-Labs department, who is in charge of all 'godly matters' in
this extensive experiment.  The most recent project implemented here is
the introduction of strangers, 'avatars', from around the world, who 
have come here to mingle and shop at our large collection of stores.
We are not concerned with visitors revealing the true natuer of the 
project, for our Memory Management team's sole purpose is to keep tabs
on any and all memory instabilities in their false environment.
~
E
mortal~
At the time of the Mortal Uprising, the Wizard Democracy held most of
the land under an iron thumb.  It ws impossible for the people to 'vote'
for a new head of state, and thus the masses had to resort to a more 
violent method of sorting out their woes.  The Wizards, while they may
have had 'their best intentions' in mind, while ruling the mortals,
wasted no time in slaughtering the masses with the 'Grand Manasplice'.
The mortal uprising was brought to a quick halt at that, although it
has been shown to have been an accidental casting, the damage was done.
The Mortal Uprising had come to an end, and with its death, the Wizard
Democracy was cast frown the sight of the people, and all of that class
vanished into the winds.
~
E
democracy~
Before the time of the Mortal Uprising and the Grand Manasplice, the
world was ruled by the Wizard Democracy.  Wizards held fearsome powers,
and the population had no arguments when they decided to run things.
Even though the people were allowed to 'vote', it was never a fair
gauge of what was truly desired amongst the masses.  When the mortals
had had enough of being pushed around by that cruel class of avatars,
the Mortal Uprising began.  The Wizard Democracy had ruled with an 
iron thumb for far too long, and the mortals resorted to hiring classes
in attempt to take down the ruthless avatars in charge.  Some mortals
even dared to become avatars themselves to join in the fight against
disguised tyranny.
~
E
manasplice~
The Grand Manasplice, or, the 'Casting of Doom'
During the Mortal Uprisings, a wizard of (then) unknown origin created
an all powerful spell, designed to easily rid the world of all of the 
'pesky mortals' that tended to destroy the land, leech the resources, 
and die too early.  The avatars were spared this fate, but, most of
the mortals, and the entire city, were practically destroyed in one
foul casting.  It is common knowledge around 'Memory Management' that
the true source of this destructive and fatal knowledge was none other
than the 'God of Wisdom' himself, Magna.  While rumored to be a figment
of the imagination, as was the 'Goddess Alesyira', discovery of his
creation of the spell revealed him to be a true and frightening being.
He is still worshipped in some circles as the taker of life, although
his spell was never meant to be used for such an overwhelming massacre.
~
E
magna~
The God Magna, which, we're sure has been created to appease our desire
for knowledge, is still considered to be a 'living' god.  One who really
exits, really assists, and teaches us many things we would take so much
longer to discover.  It has yet to be confirmed with actual evidence.
Studies have shown, however, that he favors those individuals that are
'uncircumcised' with ideas and knowledge that tends to impress and wow
members of the opposite gender.  This fact is tried and true, as testi-
fied by our very own Dr. Trauth.
~
E
seth~
This is the true creator of our lands, and, while he does his best with 
managing the major details, like, KEEPING US ALL ALIVE, the small 
details, such as the happier things in ilfe, like clean air, safety,
and lives free from stress tend to be overlooked in his busy schedule.
It is because of him that we've created this experiment, in a tightly
controlled environment, to test the quality of life as it is run by mere
mortals, instead of an almighty immortal being.  We only hope he chooses
to not interfere with our tests.
~
E
alesyira~
This 'goddess' is the 'source of renewed life' in Andriel.  The figure
of this woman stands as a fountain in the city square, to give the 
people a reason as to why they still exist, and to give them something 
to believe in, even though all they know has been 'lost'.  We've found
her to be an excellent source of trust and faith, and the people are 
content to stay in her 'warm embrace'.

While the removal of all memories is possible, subject behavior is 
deeply ingrained into the psychology of the person, and thier actions
will remain unaltered, UNLESS you can install a new memory that will
override their current tastes and preferences.  I.E., it is possible
to turn a completely peaceful nun into a sadist by altering memories
of her upbringing.  But, unless the memory replacement is achieved
perfectly, and without a hitch, the prior-nyn will find no joy in her
new lifestylem and will most likely revert to her old 'habit' (pun!)
It has recently been discovered that the solution to this memory ...

sits underneath a sunlamp on the desk.  From the books on the shelf, you

genetic code.  I spent way too long trying to perfect that breed, 
and I'd better not find out who overrode my authority on it.  I 
had planned on working out the aggressive nature of it, because 
the damned thing wouldn't stop trying to KILL me during test 
phases...

A kitchen~
A small kitchenette, with dainty cabinets and drawers to contain supplies
and cooking utensils; it truly whispers, 'A woman lives here,' from the 
pastel pink flowers printed on the painted white drawers, to the frilly 
drying cloths hung on the oven handle.  A spice rack sits on the mantle
next to an impressive display of custom-made knives, probably crafted by
the blacksmith that works upstairs.

A small living room~
A small set of couches circle a plain coffee table.  It looks like the
residents here have no desire for fancy living, just enought to be 
comfortable in their time off.  A book lies on the table, and a forgotten 
cup of coffee is next to it, cold as ice.

There are a few small tables around this room, along with a bar-like 
countertop near the eastern wall.  A few high-tech coffee machines

#7Avian Subject #C154#n
Species 'Anslet' survived test phases, plans to release the upgraded
species to the city have been approved by RD5 as suitable matches 
to current memory settings.  Maru mentioned the slight differences 
between our surviving subjects and the target memory might prove to 
be slightly problematic, but, the attempts to recreate those beings 
exactly failed, usually with fatal results to the embryos.
~
E
138~
#7Avian Subject #C138#n
Another slight failure with our avian creations, the 'Magri' has 
developed the same soft-feather condition as its predecessor, 
'Pholos'.  This species managed to retain its ability to fly, 
however.  The colorful tailfeathers will not harden upon bird 
maturity, causing a slight imbalance during flight.  While suited 
nicely for domestic purposes and city beautification, the species 
is unsuitable for release into the wild.
~
E
112~
#7Avian Subject #C112#n
'Pholos', has shown, upon maturity, to not lose its juvenile feathers,
instead remaining downy and soft, with the unfortunate side effect of
inability to fly.  RD5 has approved leaving the species in circulation,
stating that the few inhabitants that visit the bird sanctuary do not 
notice that there is a definite difference in the birds.
~
E
87~
#7Avian Subject #C87#n
Species 'Zorea' has proven to be one of our easier recreations.  The
slight size modification, with an added pigment to the feathers was
more easily accomplished than our past attempts, with fewer fatalities
during test phases.  The most difficult part of the genetic structure
was the implementation of poison glands.  Ettophe was nearly killed
in a related mishap, causing the restructuring of safety measures.

of the small hill by the road.  The den seems to go furthur back, 
dropping a bit deeper into the ground.  A strange smell permeates

is strange trail leading into the back of the den from the entrance.

A Hallway~
You're standing in a greyish hallway, lit with a few sparse lights.  There 
are doors on either side of you, marked simply with numbers.  The hall
continues to the north.

Storage Room Two~
You're standing in the middle of a large storage room.  There are boxes piled
on shelves lined up against the far wall, filled with perhaps thousands of 
individual food rations.  Nearby boxes have labels to indicate that they're 
filled with dried goods and dehydrated drink mixes.

Storage Room Three~
You're standing in the middle of a large storage room.  There are countless
stacks of industry-sized canned foods lining the numerous shelves.  Some of 
the lower shelves house boxes, but even the boxes are full of cans.  A small 
step-ladder is near the wall to your right.

Storage Room Eight~
The interior of this room reeks of a sickly sweet scent.  Several shelves
line the walls, and the northern wall is comprised entirely of large glass
containment units.  One near the lower right has shattered, spilling its
contents onto the floor.  That wouldn't be a problem if this room were just 
another food storage area, but most of the containers in here are marked 
with the 'biohazard' symbol.  The ventilation shaft near the broken glass
case has a loose cover.

Inside the contaminated ventilation shaft~
You're squished into a narrow vent with no room to turn around.  It looks as 
though you can only go forward from here.  The sickly sweet odor of rotting 
biohazardous waste is thick in this stale, unmoving air.

Inside the contaminated ventilation shaft~
You're squished into a narrow vent with no room to turn around.  The vent 
splits here, going to the south and east.  The sickly sweet odor of rotting
biohazardous waste is thick in this stale, unmoving air.

Inside the contaminated ventilation shaft~
You're squished into a narrow vent with no room to turn around.  The air duct
turns south here, ending shortly in another loose-fitting vent cover.  The 
sickly sweet odor of rotting biohazardous waste is thick in this stale air.

Storage Room One~
You're standing in a very large storage room.  There are boxes lined along 
the walls and shelves that follow the room's perimeter.  In the center of 
the room is a pile of rubble from previous shelving units that have been 
crushed and sent asunder by an unknown force.  Broken and emptied crates of
dehydrated food products are strewn across the floor.  The biohazard 
contamination that has leaked into the room through the ventilation shaft 
has caused some sort of mutation amongst the dried foods...
