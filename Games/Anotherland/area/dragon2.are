An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
This path appears to be very old, and well travelled. It amazes you that you
have never noticed it was here before.  That is until you look back and
realize that the clay road is completely invisible to you from here.  To the
east, the path continues.  It appears that the western opening you entered
through is now impassible.  You are here whether you like it or not....
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.

An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
The path is becoming more and more difficult to traverse now, as the trees seem
to reach out to strangle you.  You feel like you are utterly alone, and, if not
for the mountain you can now see in the distance, would probably just recall to
Midgaard.  But then again, who ever said that adventuring was easy?

You finally burst free from the grasp of the wood, only to find yourself at
the foot of a path.  The path leads north, to the mountain which has, until
now been your only beacon.  Now that you can better see the ominous mountain
looming before you,  you begin to rethink the idea of recalling to Midgaard.

You have reached the foot of the great mountain.  Here, the dragon stench
is almost strong enough to disable you.  The only way you are able to stand it
is by ripping of a piece of cloth, and covering your mouth and nose with it as
you walk.  Far above you, you see what must be the entrance to the cave.

Now that you have something to somthing to concentrate upon, scaling the
mountain, you are actually able to think more clearly.  You have encountered
dragons before, and vanquished them, why should these be any different.
This thought continues rolling through your mind, but as you reach the next
level of the cliff, it does little to ease your fear.

The first thing you are aware of is that the mountain itself seems to breathe.
In and out goes its breath, constantly in and out.  You suddenly hear footsteps
approaching from all around you, and brace for combat.  It takes you a few
moments to realize that the sound was your heart beating.

The ledge on the Mountain~
You have reached a small ledge about one fourth of the way up the mountain.
To the east is the entrance to what seems to be a small cave.  The only hint
as to the size of the cave are the screams that are echoing from within it,
which seem to last an eternity.

Entrance to the Cave~
Once inside the cave you feel completely lost to the outside world.  All
around you are horrific sounds of death and fear.  The walls are all stained
with many differing shades of red or brown, with a few frost particles
glittering on one of the walls.  Even with the cloth, the smell of the dragons
is almost unbearable.

You are beginning to feel very unnerved.  Since you have been walking through
DragonSpyre, the screams had been slowly dying off, and now they are no more.
Normally the lack of death cries would be a welcome change, only now they
have been replaced by a very eerie silence.  You don't like this one bit.

you want to go west.  The giggling that has been following you around has

stands before you, glaring at you with its pale blue eyes.  All around, the
walls are coated with a thick layer of ice.  You slip several times before
gaining your balance enough to face the fearsome beast.  Will you fight it,
or flee?  "It is JUST a dragon."

The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here,
the walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.
It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on
for all eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might
not be that long of a distance.

The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here,
the walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.
It feels like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on
for all eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might
not be that long of a distance.

Lair of the Copper Dragon~
Within the bounds of this room, time has seemed to stop.  There is no
movement, save for the large mass at the back of the room.  Out of the
corner of you eye, you manage to catch a glimpse of a droplet of water
"falling" from a stalagtite...it appears to have been in the same position
for the past century.  You have no chance to move before the Dragon strikes.

Treasure Room~
All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.        It has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the       Dragon and the original families considered these items "treasure", you
manage to find little of value beside a pile of gold coins you collect.
