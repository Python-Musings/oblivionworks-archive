The Enclave General's Office~
You are in a very orderly office. In front of you is a
BEAUTIFUL polished mahogany desk. Where they found the wood
in this wasteland is well beyond your grasp of knowledge
yet here it is. The walls are all a metal of some kind
and the only exit is the hydraulic door behind you.

As you travel the hallway there is no ambient noise
except for that which you create on your own, and the
occasional voices over the commlinks of the patrols
as they check in. Your breathing and heartbeat seem
to increase in volume, and are begining to drive you 
mad. There is a door to the north, and through the
porthole it appears to be an office of some sort.

Library~
This library ironically has a rather small
amount of books. During the war many books
were destroyed in the initial blasts. Now
they are on terminals which are spread
evenly throughout the room. Students come
here to study and to download copys for
their own personal uses.

This office is extremly disorganised! The desk
is Cluttered with papers, books lay all over

A war torn path~
As you walk down this crappy road you can
see a small building to the south, and
the remnants of an old city to the
northeast. Between you and the city is a
vast expanse of nothing but irradiated
desert.

however there is a small gap about 6 feet wide leading up to a walkway.  
The road is blocked to the south by a large pile of rubble from a

The building is rather worn down, as all the buildings are around here.  The
guild keeps it in pretty good shape though.  Patches of brick and mortar
cover the exterior.  Through the windows you can see movement, but it's too

Angel and Kipper connect at this location.  Angel is notorious for the
street thugs who constantly break out in fights.  Each contending for their
dominance of the neighborhood, but all afraid to venture very far into
slaver territory or the mafia's neighborhoods.

Annihilated buildings dominate Jasper.  The Cabrinis do not allow any
construction on this road because they use the buildings for cover during

Intersection: Jasper and Cabrini~
There is a large metal gate to the north guarded by 2 large men with guns
and three english mastiff bulls.  Cabrini Drive is extremly well kept.  Mr. 
Cabrini would have it no other way.  A long stretch of battered and
crumbeling buildings go to east from here.  There is an eerie silence to the
east as well....

Intersection: Brahmin and Buckshot~
Vast fields of brahmin fill your vison.  A couple of slaughterhouses and
barns stand along the side of Brahmin street in either direction.  The
sandstorm has closed in behind you blocking southbound travel on Buckshot
Row, but it seems to not be moving any closer.

Edge of a Gravel Path~
Brahmin Road fades to nothing as it nears the cliff edge.  Sand and dirt
take over here, and the land stops moving out further about 20 feet to the
east and drops straight down several hundred feet.  There seems to a small
path worn into the earth leading south.

Unsavory travelers wander on this street as women sell themselves from
the roadside.  Sounds of both joy and pain pierce the air, and drunks and
druggies wobble along like animated corpses.

Intersection: Angel and Radioactive~
You're feet sink into the deep pool of rocks ast you stand here looking
to the east down angel road.  You can hear the fighting from over there, but
can't see past past a large bridge which passes above both Angel Street and
Fusiion Creek.  The path you stand on runs both north and south before
turning west.
