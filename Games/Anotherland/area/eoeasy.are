You had never quite believed the woodcuts in the Book of Jezekiel, but it
appears they were totally true to life.
  The Evil Ones stand four feet high, and their body looks almost exactly
like a longhaired kiwi with four little pink paws sticking out of it, two
huge round eyes, and a tiny round mouth. This one happens to be blonde.

This is an Evil One of the Death From Above circle. His fur is short in
front, but longer at the back and very long behind his head. Overall, it
gives the impression of a small furry God swooping out of the sky on fire,
razorsharp (if miniscule) claws bared to tear out whoever's throat it lands
on.
  Probably the God of Kiwis though.

One of the Death Squad is charging straight at you, screaming loudly.
~
The Death Squad are the creme de la creme of the Evil Ones. These are the
toughest of the Evil One crunch troops. On entry, every Death Squad Evil
One is shaved to the skin. A month later, if the Evil One has survived
training that long, it's fur is dyed blood red. The longer the red part,
the fiercer the Death Squad trooper.
  This Evil One must a raw recruit, for it's entire coat is red. There is a
significant amount of red however; this Evil One was probably the pride of
the camp.

it's only an inch long though, and along it's stomach you can see the
remains of where 'Washout' had been shaved in. The Death Squad are not kind.

evil one fardeath~
a Fardeath Evil One~
A Fardeath Evil One stands here calmly, firing arrow after arrow at you.
~
The Fardeath circle is not so tough in training as the Death Squad, but
more selective for candidates. In the Book of Jezekiel, it tells how any
Fardeath who cannot shoot through both ears of a running hare by the time
they finish training are removed from the circle, in the only way possible.
  Fardeath are ranked by the number of blue stripes they have. Every time
they kill, the magic of the Evil Ones causes a stripe to appear on their
fur. The loathed Chrizza, he who once ran the Fardeath, and who could kill
four men with every shaft, was rumoured to have turned entirely blue. The
stripes then ran black, and finally, when his last blue patch turned black,
he disappeared.
  But a single stripe crosses this Fardeath's coat. Obviously a very new
recruit, but you remember one story from the Book of Jezekiel which
indicated that one novice, likewise with but a single stripe, had been so
ashamed by it that his next battle he managed to stripe half his fur. Your
ancestors mourn that day.

A fire daemon runs towards you, the path smoking in it's wake.
~
The fire daemons are the most terrible of the Evil One's forces. Nominally,
they resemble white rabbits; the fangs, the claws, the red gleam in their
eyes. But the plumes of fire, the destruction and the death that occur
wherever it goes, most of all the pink fur, reveal it to be something far
deadlier. A fire daemon.

When the Great Circle was founded, and the Portal was built, guardians
became necessary to guard both. The Evil Ones and their demonic allies
laboured for a year and a day on the problem, and devised these golems.
  Shaped from black stone to look like giant mice, the guardians stand
together to guard the Portal, each at his place. And when the Portal is
threatened, they use its power to defend it.

Once, she was Hope.

At last, you have reached the peak of the Mountain. You breathe in deeply,
tasting the sharpness of the air, and take a moment to look at the view.
  However, the Great Circle of the Evil Ones must be destroyed. And to do
that, you must descend, into the heart of the Mountain.

Pile of Leaves~
A huge pile of leaves is here, testimony to the Evil One's cruelty. They
don't want you dead; they want you in the torture chamber.

huge pile leaves~
Whole trees must have been stripped of their leaves to make this pile. Even
so, the fall was pretty hard.~

Melted Tunnel~
The Evil Ones must have used great magic when they made this place, for the
rock has been burnt away, not cut. Tunnels have been melted to the east and
west.

Guard Post~
The tunnel opens seamlessly into a small round cave, presumably an Evil One
guardpost. A bunker rests next to each cot for the Evil Ones to hide in
until they are ready to leap out and slaughter their enemies.

Some kind of explosion must have been triggered here, for the cavern is a
perfect sphere. You shudder at the power of the magic required to burn away
rock like kindling, and your resolve only deepens to destroy the Evil Ones
for good.

Square Passage~
The rock here appears to have been too much for even the fire demons.
However, the walls remain perfectly smooth. Indeed, the workmanship chills
you with it's precision, for no human hands could have hewn a tunnel so
precisely square as this. Other demons must have been summoned, demons of
rock and earth. You had always known the Evil Ones had a terrible kinship
with fire, but to learn they have power of rock as well is terrible.
  The corridor leads west, and a square hole in the ground leads into darkness.

This appears to be where the jailer of the Evil Ones spends most of his
time. You wonder why on earth they bother to have a jailer, since the Evil
Ones don't feed their prisoners, don't care who their prisoners are, and
never, ever release prisoners.

The Great Circle~
Finally, you have found the Great Circle of the Evil Ones. It is here that
they conduct foul rites and practise forbidden rites, calling upon all the
fiends of Hell to plague the godfearing citizens of Hancom.
  The Portal beckons you in the centre of the Circle, but to the north and
south, to the east and west, lie the chambers of those who have been the
enemies of your people for generations. Destiny awaits.

Chamber of Passion~
Before you, a bizarre play is being performed.
  The first scene you see is in a street, a piglike man lying between a
young woman's legs. She is screaming with pain, but he continues, grunting
loudly. At length he finishes, stands, and walks off, but the woman remains
on the floor, not moving.
  They fade away, and the next scene shows him in a shop. He and his
brother are debating the price of a sword, and neither will budge. In the
end, the hero grows furious, and lops off his brother's head.
  Finally, you see the man at home, curled up on the floor crying with
sorrow. A second brother walks in, and demands that he defend himself, but
he refuses to pause in his grief, and is himself killed.
  A strange play indeed...

Chamber of Despair~
Nothing much, just a plain room. Blank, whitewashed walls. Trash all over
the floor. An unmade bed. Hideously maimed bodies are piled against the
walls, some apparently still breathing; but nevermind. Dust to dust, ashes
to ashes. Nothing you do can really change anything; on the grand scale,
after all, we barely exist.
  You just want to crawl into bed, fit into the dent you have made over all
these years, and abandon the world.

nothing".
  You are sitting on a solid gold throne, thousands of precious gems piled
up around you. On the floor at your left sits Lizabelle, the collar around
her throat proclaiming how she has finally given in to you.
