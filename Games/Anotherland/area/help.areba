0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

-1 ALIAS~
The alias system.

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

By typing cc <target>, the player now casts dispel magic on that target.
To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

~

0 ARENA~
The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

~

7 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

level 10 : Cloak of Death (Regen boost when your just about to die).

~

0 AUSPEX~
This Discipline is one of extrasensory awareness, empathy and 
perception.  Those using this Discipline tend to be strongly affected by 
environmental phenomena.  Vampires with Auspex are able to see and sense 
things most other people cannot.  Auspex is the opposing Discipline to 
Obfuscate, and they cancel out many of each others powers.

-1 Apocalypse~
#0APOCALYPSE MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Apocalypse.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if apocalypse is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing apocalypse the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during apocalypse.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
theapocalypse command. ie. 'apocalypse 200' will add 200 qps
to the apocalypse pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on apocalypse). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and apocalypse cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Apocalypse lasts 15 minutes.

Enjoy

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

7 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.
~

0 BATTLEMAGES MAGE MAGES~
The battlemages are powerful wizards that use their knowledge of the arcane
to help them in combat. They can command the elements to help or destroy
those they choose. A mage is indeed someone to fear.

Chant      - Use the common spells all battlemages have.
Invoke     - Learn or use some of the more powerful magics.
Magics     - Keep track of what magical affects affects you.
Teleport   - Teleport to any given location.
Objectgate - Summon items from afar.
Truesight  - Enhanced vision.
Discharge  - Discharge your elementalshields (striking everyone in the room)
Scry       - Use your farvision.
Reveal     - Reveals everyone in the room.
Magearmor  - Make magical equipment.
Magetalk   - Class channel.
Chaosmagic - Random spell effect.

Also note that the better the mage is at casting spells (higher spell levels),
the more powerful the spells they cast become.

NOTE : Battlemages are a unique class made for Dystopia.

~

0 BLINDNESS~
Syntax: cast blindness <victim>

This spell renders the target character blind.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 BREW SCRIBE CARVE ENGRAVE BAKE~
Syntax: cast brew <potion> <spell>
Syntax: cast scribe <scroll> <spell>
Syntax: cast carve <wand> <spell>
Syntax: cast engrave <staff> <spell>

which is usually created via the 'minor creation' spell.
~

1 BRIEF4 BRIEF3 BRIEF2 BRIEF1~

recieve from looking and combat.

brief1 -> Information when you look toggled between short/long.
brief2 -> Toggle shields, misses and weapon burn/freeze in combat.
brief3 -> Toggle dodge/parry messages in combat.
brief4 -> Toggle message on exp modifiers, discipline points and class points.

~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harrash players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harrash players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harrashment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~

0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce ( 1/4th of their exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even crack the skull and eat their brains ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>
~

0 KDECAPITATE~
Unless you want to get your pkscore up and your in a kingdom, you should use kdecap.
It instead gives your pk to your kingdom, not you.
Same thing as decap, just your pk is put somewhere else.

~

0 DEMON DEMONS~
Demons are mortals who have sold their souls for power, but they must take the souls
of others to make their power grow, for they are the foul beasts of hell that will
stop at nothing to rule the world. To steal a soul, you must simply decap another player.

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 EXPERIENCE XP~
#n #n
Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the level of the mob being killed.
There are also different modifiers like happy hour and newbie exp.

The exp modifiers are as listed :

* Newbie hours (The first 4 hours) : gives 200 % extra exp.
* Happy (Immortals can set this)   : gives 100 % extra exp.
* Pkscore (only positive value)    : gives   1 % for each 50 pkscore.
* Tithe (worshippers only)         : gives  -5 % exp (that's less)
* Mccp   (read Help mccp)          : gives  25 % extra exp.
* Alignment (explained below)      : gives +/- 25% extra exp.

#GAlignment explaned#n
If your kill a mob of the opposite alignment as yourself, fx. if your
aligned good and you kill an evil mob, you gain 25% extra exp from
the kill. BUT if your the same alignment as the mob you get 25% LESS
exp from killing that mob.

#GGuidelines about modifiers#n
* DO NOT ask immortals to turn on Happy Hour!
* Use #ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #yANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

~

0 'FAERIE FOG'~
Syntax: cast 'faerie fog'

This spell reveals all manner of invisible, hidden, and sneaking creatures in
the same room as you.
~

0 FASTDRAW~
FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax: cast 'fly' <character>

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

7 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

-1 FORGE~

* copper = 3/3, iron = 6/6, steel = 9/9, adamantite = 12/12
 
#GForging hilts onto weapons gives strange effects, depending on what spell the weapon had already.#n
#GShould a weapon not have any spell to begin with, the effect will be :#n

0 FORTITUDE~
Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping
the weapons from harming them at all.

1 KATANAS~
In the beginning all was chaos and evil reigned supreme across the
lands of Dystopia, the Lords of Light were pushed back to the farthest 
reaches of the universe, their memory almost forgotten.  In their 
darkest hour they hatched a plan to try and restore Law and Order,
looking across the lands they found Sheol a warrior of pure evil, 
looking upon this foul creature they pooled their powers to plant a 
seed of light into his heart.  This seed of light slowly grew 
eventually consuming the darkness and finally a new warrior torn with 
guilt over his previous crimes was born.  The Lords of Light then 
approached Sheol and explained the way to retribution and so was born 
the Church of the Celestial Samurai and its fighting arm known simply 
as the Katanas.
 
Sheol was then tasked with scouring the land looking for other warriors 
to join the fight against the tide of evil.  The task was not an easy 
one, however slowly a small band of Samurai and Angels were found to 
uphold the honour and virtue of the Lords of Light and slowly and order 
began to be returned to the land.
 
As a Katana fighting for the Church of the Celestial Samurai you are 
expected to act accordingly with strength and honour. This will involve 
helping out new souls that have just been born to the land, and seeking 
retribution on those whose foul hearts deserve it, but in order to 
attain these lofty goals only the strongest of pure heart are chosen.
 
Requirements
Class        : Samurai, Angel
Alignment    : Good
Stats        : HP/Move both over 100k

0 LICH~
#n #n
Lichs are powerful sorceres that have cheated death by entering a state of
living death. No longer subject to the affects of time, they use their time
to explore other planes and perfect their magic. The lichs grow in power, far
beyond that of most mortal mages, since they have so much more time to perfect
their art. If you thought mages were scary, try fighting a lich that has used
the last 2000 years comming up with nasty spells to kill and destroy.

Masters of conjuring, death, life, necromantics and chaos, lichs have
acces to several powers, some of them are know as :

Conjuring   : Objectgate, Fireball, Planartravel, Golemsummon, Pentagram.
Death       : Readaura, Chillhand, Painwreck, Creeping Doom.
Life        : Regeneration, Earthswallow, Powertransfer, Polarity.
Necromantic : Zombie, Soulsuck, Planarstorm, Planeshift.
Chaos Magic : Chaosmagic, Chaossurge, Chaosshield.

Note : Lichs are a unique class made for Dystopia.

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

7 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

~

1 MCCP~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n
 
Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If your client do not support mccp theres another way to use mccp,
the instructions on how to do this can be found on the following
page, and it takes no more than 2-3 minutes to get working.

#Ghttp://www.daimi.au.dk/#-jobo/dystopia/mccp.html#n

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

0 MONKCHI~
A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~
By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.

Lightning Kick - Strikes the opponent with a series of powerful kicks.
Tornado Kick   - Strikes everyone in the room with kicks.
Choyoken       - A devastating attack that targets the opponents stamina.
Raptor Strike  - An attack that syphons the mystical energies of the target.
Nerve Pinch    - A series of attacks targeted at central nerves, paralysing.

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

0 NINJAS~
Ninja's are warriors trained in the dark art of Ninjutsu.  They fight
using stealth and quickness making them a deadly foe.  Ninja's have few, yet
powerful powers at their disposal, and when these powers are mastered a 
ninja can be a most powerful adversary.  Through stealth a ninja can sneak
upon a victim and do a deadly amount of damage, and if this is not enough
they can slink away and hide in the shadows.  However, if you try to run
from a master ninja you shall find yourself hard pressed to make it out
alive.

It is vital for a ninja to focus his or her Ki, this is done with the command
'michi'. A ninja CANNOT regen while not in a state of michi. Ninjas are   
ranked with a system of belts. Each belt adds more punch to the ninjas
abilities in combat, meaning more damage, better dodge, more attacks, etc.
Belts can be trained with the command 'train beltX' where X is the current
belt that the ninja wish to learn.

Read help on principles.

0 OBFUSCATE~
Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds

the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Pdox takes your hp/mana/move back down to -10.
Takes 1k qp off you.
IF you don't have 1k qp, 1 generation, if no generations aval, 1 upgrade, if no upgrade
ALL YOUR WEAPONS RESET, So don't fuck with ppl lower then you.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G#y(actually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possibly Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.

0 PROTEAN~
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.

<<*>> #rClaws#n Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
      claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.

more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.
For your Customized title like my -=<AyU>=-, it will cost 5k QP.

For more information, type 'quest'.

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT

Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or

Having more than 1000 pkscore will not reduce the cost for upgrading.

It is possibly for an upgrade to improve their powers even
more, read HELP UPGRADE2 to check out the facts.

~

1 AUTOCLASS~
Autoclassing is a way to choose among some of the more powerful classes.
But....
You can stay Base class throughout your upgrades.
This is the process:
A person wanting base class when upgrading:
He only uses upgrade, never autoclass.
A person wanting the upgraded class:
He uses selfclass, then upgrades, then gets 5kqp and 100million exp,
then autoclass, then uses upgrade from there.
command upgrade. Simple?

You need 5k Qp and 100million exp.

~

1 UPGRADE2~
When a player have upgrade to his new class, he/she can upgrade
again and again, though instead of losing his or her old class and

warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will

A pair of leathery wings protrude from your back.

The warps with (*) doesn't have any affect, and some of the warps are
used together with inparts or disciplines, most are just extra attacks
in combat or extra toughnes.

Maybe some day when I have some spare time, I'll clean up the demon powers,
but currently you'll just have to live with the mess.

1 WHO~
Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

Enjoy!
