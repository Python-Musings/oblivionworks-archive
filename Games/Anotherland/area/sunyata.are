the tortured being~
Some poor creature screams its pain in silence.
~
A hideous, tortured creature writhes in agony. You have no idea what's keeping
the thing alive, for every scrap of skin has been ripped off it and blood
wells from broken bones. Perhaps it has something to do with the pink glow
around it, but it's more likely that it's yet another parasite feeding on the
unfortunate.

A black pantherlike beast looks straight into your eyes.

It looks remarkably like an old-Earth panther; apart from four octopuslike
tentacles sprouting from it's shoulders. Despite this, it appears to be
regressing somewhat too because it has enormous sabre teeth. Enormous, bloody
teeth.

The crystal is an awesome sight. Unflawed, it is shaped like a three-

every colour of the spectrum, and as it turns, you can't help but be fascinated
by it's mathematical splendour.

the shadow~
A shadowy figure stands here, intent on something.
~
The shadow is very well-defined, and you can see everything he does. First he
looks about cautiously. Then he takes a vial and syringe from his lab coat,
and pierces the vial. Finally, he injects it into him. He has time to hide the
syringe and vial under a bush before he collapses to the ground and slowly
fades from view, only to reappear a few minutes later and repeat his actions.

The second time you watch him, you realise who he is. He's you.

A fleeting glance at him reveals his panic. He's struggling furiously, but
seems to be held prone at two points by something tremendously strong. Slowly
he is lifted up, then positioned over the tank. A final look of horror passes
over his face before he's dumped into the tank and dissolves in a screaming
mess, only to reappear on the floor.

are set within, and they almost glow when the light hits them, despite being
set perfectly smoothly into the dark stone.~

doesn't sound tempting.
  Beside you lies a katana. Behind you is a distinct lack of starship. And in
front of you lies...

SUNYATA.

Massive trunks support a thick covering of leaves, intercepting almost all of

vegetation is limited to just enough that you won't see whatevers about to

A thousand different species of bird flit through the air here. It may be your
imagination; but every one of those species seem to have evolved into
something altogether more lethal than the original.

You're swimming in the aquarium. Though with thought it seems reasonable, you

Kitchen~
The most welcoming room yet, with actual synthwood tables and chairs. It
actually served mostly as a dining room, since food preparation is an automated
task nowadays, but it was decided that having a kitchen promoted a more
relaxing atmosphere, maximising the benefits of rest time.

Control~
>From here, every station function is controlled. Or at least, used to be. The
KANT system has been attacked, ferociously but, fortunately, ignorantly.
  While all user interface has been destroyed beyond hope of repair, KANT is
apparently still running well enough to keep the air breathable. May it remain
so.

Experimental 2~
This appears to be the central part of an experimental lab, for huge white
machines are all about. You recognise a mass spectrometer, a genetic simulation
unit, an actualization tank...   This must have been where you worked, for you
remember every piece of equipment, it's function and operation.
  Unfortunately the whole lot is useless at the moment, for there is not enough
power getting through to light a fluorescent tube.

airshower air shower~
Spacetravel has required many improvements over existing inventions. The
airshower is one of the more questionable of these, composing a shower of
reusable solvent followed by a blast of air that removes the last traces of
solvent, incidentally chilling the victim to the bone.~

As tiny as washbasins can be while still technically being functional. The
use of water for something as wasteful as washing or shaving is considered

A fantastic brain coral grows in the centre of the 'floor', and its grey

It slowly dawns on you, however, that the coral is pulsing very slowly, and
you turn away sickened.
