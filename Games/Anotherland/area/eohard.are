an Evil One~
An Evil One stares at you, it's eyes glowing red.
~
You had never quite believed the woodcuts in the Book of Jezekiel, but it
appears they were totally true to life.
  The Evil Ones stand four feet high, and their body looks almost exactly
like a longhaired kiwi with four little pink paws sticking out of it, two
huge round eyes, and a tiny round mouth. This one happens to be blonde.

a Death From Above Evil One~
An Evil One hurls itself on you from above, razor sharp claws ready to kill.
~
This is an Evil One of the Death From Above circle. His fur is short in
front, but longer at the back and very long behind his head. Overall, it
gives the impression of a small furry God swooping out of the sky on fire,
razorsharp (if miniscule) claws bared to tear out whoever's throat it lands
on.
  Probably the God of Kiwis though.

a Die Screaming Evil One~
An Evil One runs down the Mountain, screaming a fierce war cry.
~
Now that you look closer, you can see that he's snowboarding. That would
explain how he manages to go over all the sharp rocks without screaming.
His fur streams out behind him similarly to that of the Death From Above
Evil Ones, with an unfortunately similar effect.

a Death Squad Evil One~
One of the Death Squad is charging straight at you, screaming loudly.
~
The Death Squad are the creme de la creme of the Evil Ones. These are the
toughest of the Evil One crunch troops. On entry, every Death Squad Evil
One is shaved to the skin. A month later, if the Evil One has survived
training that long, it's fur is dyed blood red. The longer the red part,
the fiercer the Death Squad trooper.
  This Evil One must a raw recruit, for it's entire coat is red. There is a
significant amount of red however; this Evil One was probably the pride of
the camp.

  This Evil One must a raw recruit, for it's entire coat is red. Most of
it's only an inch long though, and along it's stomach you can see the
remains of where 'Washout' had been shaved in. The Death Squad are not kind.

evil one fardeath~
a Fardeath Evil One~
A Fardeath Evil One stands here calmly, firing arrow after arrow at you.
~
The Fardeath circle is not so tough in training as the Death Squad, but
more selective for candidates. In the Book of Jezekiel, it tells how any
Fardeath who cannot shoot through both ears of a running hare by the time
they finish training are removed from the circle, in the only way possible.
  Fardeath are ranked by the number of blue stripes they have. Every time
they kill, the magic of the Evil Ones causes a stripe to appear on their
fur. The loathed Chrizza, he who once ran the Fardeath, and who could kill
four men with every shaft, was rumoured to have turned entirely blue. The
stripes then ran black, and finally, when his last blue patch turned black,
he disappeared.
  But a single stripe crosses this Fardeath's coat. Obviously a very new
recruit, but you remember one story from the Book of Jezekiel which
indicated that one novice, likewise with but a single stripe, had been so
ashamed by it that his next battle he managed to stripe half his fur. Your
ancestors mourn that day.

A fire daemon runs towards you, the path smoking in it's wake.
~
The fire daemons are the most terrible of the Evil One's forces. Nominally,
they resemble white rabbits; the fangs, the claws, the red gleam in their
eyes. But the plumes of fire, the destruction and the death that occur
wherever it goes, most of all the pink fur, reveal it to be something far
deadlier. A fire daemon.

When the Great Circle was founded, and the Portal was built, guardians
became necessary to guard both. The Evil Ones and their demonic allies
laboured for a year and a day on the problem, and devised these golems.
  Shaped from black stone to look like giant mice, the guardians stand
together to guard the Portal, each at his place. And when the Portal is
threatened, they use its power to defend it.

Now her hair is matted and filthy. Her eyes have turned black, and the
sword and the cause have tarnished until they are nearly corroded away.
Once, she was Hope.
Hope has been replaced by Despair.

Square Passage~
The rock here appears to have been too much for even the fire demons.
However, the walls remain perfectly smooth. Indeed, the workmanship chills
you with it's precision, for no human hands could have hewn a tunnel so
precisely square as this. Other demons must have been summoned, demons of
rock and earth. You had always known the Evil Ones had a terrible kinship
with fire, but to learn they have power of rock as well is terrible.
  The corridor leads west, and a square hole in the ground leads into darkness.

Jailer's Office~
This appears to be where the jailer of the Evil Ones spends most of his
time. You wonder why on earth they bother to have a jailer, since the Evil
Ones don't feed their prisoners, don't care who their prisoners are, and
never, ever release prisoners.

"The Portal ist thy goal; reach that, and thy valor is great. Yet stand not
still, for the greatest challenge of all is yet to fall upon thee. Through
the Portal, thou shalt uncover those Evil Ones of the Great Circle. Destroy
these creatures! for having slain them, the heart of all Evil Ones shall
burn."
  Jezekiel II, 5:39-43.

The Great Circle~
Finally, you have found the Great Circle of the Evil Ones. It is here that
they conduct foul rites and practise forbidden rites, calling upon all the
fiends of Hell to plague the godfearing citizens of Hancom.
  The Portal beckons you in the centre of the Circle, but to the north and
south, to the east and west, lie the chambers of those who have been the
enemies of your people for generations. Destiny awaits.

Chamber of Passion~
Before you, a bizarre play is being performed.
  The first scene you see is in a street, a piglike man lying between a
young woman's legs. She is screaming with pain, but he continues, grunting
loudly. At length he finishes, stands, and walks off, but the woman remains
on the floor, not moving.
  They fade away, and the next scene shows him in a shop. He and his
brother are debating the price of a sword, and neither will budge. In the
end, the hero grows furious, and lops off his brother's head.
  Finally, you see the man at home, curled up on the floor crying with
sorrow. A second brother walks in, and demands that he defend himself, but
he refuses to pause in his grief, and is himself killed.
  A strange play indeed...

Bill Thompson, your childhood nemesis.
Andrew Hurley, the man that had your wife.
Anthony Sykes, who made every day of your apprenticeship a misery.
Myriad others, everyone you hate, the memories of half a lifetime.
  One by one, they fade away, and you see the only real thing in the bare
chamber; a large mirror.

Chamber of Despair~
Nothing much, just a plain room. Blank, whitewashed walls. Trash all over
the floor. An unmade bed. Hideously maimed bodies are piled against the
walls, some apparently still breathing; but nevermind. Dust to dust, ashes
to ashes. Nothing you do can really change anything; on the grand scale,
after all, we barely exist.
  You just want to crawl into bed, fit into the dent you have made over all
these years, and abandon the world.

Chamber of Desire~
The people of Hancom are here, all prostrated in front of you. They are
chanting, "Hail, he who destroyed the Evil Ones! You are our lord, we are
nothing".
  You are sitting on a solid gold throne, thousands of precious gems piled
up around you. On the floor at your left sits Lizabelle, the collar around
her throat proclaiming how she has finally given in to you.
