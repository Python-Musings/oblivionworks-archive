It would suck now that i have everything done (as for everyone) but i ask,

not to mention the full sets of realm eq out there i know i have 1

Ok, i can say WHY i am complaining.
Let's see: to max ONE stat up to 50 (base?),
we used about 200 stores BEFORE you changed that bank.
Now, it will be 400 stores... for ONE stat!
So it will be 2000 for all 5... it's insane,
counting, HOW long it takes to get stores:
I mean, where do you think i got mines? Hah, i can tell:
First of all, half of my 15-20 hours i spent in the ToM,
maxing my weapons/stances. And do you see my mob kills?
Well, at least a half of it - quest mobs, because usually
i connect, and don't see anyone on, so only thing i can do - 
kill those quest mobs.
Stats are WAY too costly right now, see what i mean?
And, realm eq wasn't too cheap also
THAT is why i complain, and i'm sure that if
YOU TRY TO MAX STATS LIKE EACH PLAYER DO,
you'll see what i mean, but you don't play,
so you don't understand, what is it.

In response to the conversation between you and talyn
(which I read when I came back from being afk) You were
definately being far too aggro. I almost did nuke your
character, but decided telling you to shove it next time
I saw you would suffice. I would like to state that losing
a player does not bother me in the least. I would much
rather have a low pbase of people who can take something
and be cool rather than a a huge pbase of the opposite.
The community of this MUD has always been and always will
be more important to me than the amount of people who play
on it. This mud has seen good times and bad times in regards
to pbase and as long as we stay around it will come back
again, and when it does I would like that it be a place
where people can have some fun without exaggerated bitching.
 
#0dertaherup#n
 
P.S.- I have banned and nuked several people on general principle
for being assholes unneccesarily in the time I have been here.
Wasn't sure if that came acrossed in the note or not.

I've told you before, and I'll tell you one last time.
Not everything is as straightforward as every class's
midrounds doing the exact same damage.  Undead Knight's
are crippled in most other areas, so now they have one
good ability.  You also don't seem to have considered
that there may be other steps in progress, and this was
merely the first.  So until something has been out of
whack for a few weeks, keep a respectful tongue in your
head when brining up problems, because you barely play
anymore and have no idea of what the overall game plan
for the mud is.  Don't push me.

Subject Powerword Stun~
Text
Okay, I think it is crap that powerword stun lag was lowered.
There is enough time so that the person using powerword stun
can't use it and flee and be able to get away.  Judas proved
that.  I used powerword stun on him and tried to flee to get
away from him, he came in and attacked before I could get
away.  Now, what is the reason behind powerword stun lag being
lowered exactly?  I mean, cause with Undead Knights losing
all of their stuff, they'll become quite easily killed.
Next will it be that soulsuck will lose more dmg as well?
Or maybe that soulsuck will not heal the UK.  In my opinion,
UK's were perfect.  They didn't pwn people unless the person
just doesn't know how to work their class.  Like Gronk, he
loses because he doesn't know his class.  I have fought Judas
several times and I've lost all of those times.  Except once
in arena, but I am pretty sure he didn't try much.  I have
fought Ulrick while I was at status 4 upgrade 3 and had around
50k more hps then him.  I almost lost.
 
Okay, reason for this note, is that UK's shouldn't be getting
lowered anymore.  Just my opinion.

Maybe because you havn't asked any questions? Your
previous writing was all statements as I recall.
Do you really think we should reply to every note
that gets written? 
 
Your best bet for getting answers is to actually
catch one of us online. For the record beorn is
the one doing classes, if you can't find him and
still want to use notes please use the personal

Actually, there were questions in my first note on general board.  I
had asked why powerword stun lag was lowered to nothing.  Plus, I had
also asked why soulsuck was lowered by half *again*.  The first time,
it didn't bother me.  The first time it was doing 23k dmg so that was
cut in half.  That is very understandable.  The 2nd time it was lowered
from 10k to 5k isn't right.  Every class has at least a 10k-15k dmg middy
and with soulsuck being an Undead Knights only middy, it should do more
than 5k.  I also wrote a note on personal board to the Immortal Staff.
Received no reply.

I did not respond because contrary top your misconceptions-
Soulsuck and powerword stun are not your "only" midrounds.
Try using the other powerwords- they are there for a reason
and soulsuck was NEVER supposed to be a primary weapon
for either liches or UK's.  The fact that you apparently
were unaware of the other powerwords only confirms my
desicion to lower UK's, as you were winning with no
apparent notion of how to play your class.  Thank you and
have a nice day.

how does gensteal really work? can you only gensteal people in the

i think i was gen 5 but i couldn't gensteal a gen 2, it said
i was out of range
 
which brings me to another question, how is the range determined?

Gensteal has no range save that you must gensteal from
people of equal or lower gen.  and sometimes they resist,
so you have to try again.  That being said- what may
have happened judas, is you looked at bountylist and saw
their upgrade and got it confused with the gen column.
Lots of people been doing that lately, I'm thinking about

Okay, so I thought that it would be wise to move this note to the General
board since it no longer is an idea but rather a discussion now.  Anyways,
Dertaherup, in my idea note 19, i stated that I had checked for spellproof
and resist.  Casting both onto the chaoseq, realising that it didn't have
resist.  But since I did cast it onto it, it had resist on it when I tested
it on the ToM mobs.  It was still damaged.

trying to better understand the mechanics of the game
does weapon damage i.e. Damage is 200 to 300 (average 250).
affect the amount of damage you do by very much?

is based equally upon the two?
 
which raises another question, how does ac sort of work?

from what i understand about dragons

perhaps you just haven't discovered teh ideal breath for that certain

but i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and lets say you have
figured out the best breath to use for each situation
 
dragons don't have a particularly strong midround because they were
given a really really strong starting attack
 
use that to your advantage, i'm glad you didn't say that dragons
are fucking lame/suck shit to other classes, it only means you don't

well it seems to me that the breaths/blast is exactly like gas breath.
when i loose hp it gets weaker....
that seems unfair
if my opponent has 50% and i have 50% he'll win due so his
consitant damage and i'll loose due to my lack of damage because of the
way breaths are right now....
i don't ask to be overpowered.
but i don't wanna get walked all over either.
and Judas, thanks for the info i'll give it a try and i do use
different breaths till i see which hits the hardest.
but sometimes i get low hp and doesn't matter what breath/blast i use
cause i'll always get a low number due to hp:(
and this dragondive if that's our only means of attack
that's wrong, spam dragondive.
i don't wanna be a spammer :(
because that's what i'll have to do to get the first attack on someone
dstealth doesn't make me invis to players or anything
again i am not askin for overpowering skills or anything or my breaths up
upp'd
i just would like the fact when i loose hp my breaths don't loose power,
or loose as much power.

Subject quest mobs and TOM~
Text
I'm thinking of making a new quest type flag for mobs.
It wouldn't be worth quite as much as current quest flag
though I would up the current one a bit. The main
difference would be that it wouldn't show on questfind
so that way we coudl create permenant mobs without
spamming up the list and we could create more zones
similar to TOM.
 
I also plan to fix exp very soon to make it dynamic
so that new players can get shit from newbie castle
and old players can't (based on size not age). There
will be new zones on the way soon. And if one of you
would like to be brought on as a builder let me know
on the personal board. This doesn't mean I will
neccesary hire anyone, but it could prove helpful.
Needless to say, if you've been caught pulling shit
in the past, then you will not be hired. Though I guess
it is a needed thing to say since I had to say it... =P

Mccp was originally built as a client in its own right
Essentially working as a local proxy for compression
of incoming/outgoing data, so even telnet users can
use it. I used to use this and it works fine. If this
is the same version as the one I used many years ago
you can add in multiple mud addresses to the .cfg and
connect to them by using a different port on the connect
to 127.0.0.1
 
If you have any questions let me know, its a simple
program but I do remember being a little confused at
first.
