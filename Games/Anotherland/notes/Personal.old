rounds are like 15k.  I log on to find out that soulsuck has been
reduced even farther to 5k.  Now, that is messed up.  We barely

want to cause i can't get gen or status from it anymore. If you want proof dert
This is how he has been talking over imm talk but he won't come unimmvis.

Felis is my good friend irl and he killed me twice fair
when i had better stats on him both times and he refused 
to spar me for a third because he knew something was wrong
i have the log of his stats at the time he killed me for proof
in addition i would like to add to you Dert i was distotred as you yesterday 
which is why i appeared to look like you i never distorted to anything else
Felis did not notice i had purged all the other mobs ahead of his room 
i was looking at the levels of them for a new zone which i was going to build
as close to Test of Might as i can get
Then why he did it i have no clue he was running from skot who was trying to
kill him his fight timer went away and i was on my alt dez
i was leveling in the training room minding my own business
when i am booted off because someone had logged on to dez
Felis is the only one who knows my password to all my chars except
this guy and ulrick when i tried to get back on dez he had been deleted
i have the log when my body was taken over and it is highly unlikely that
anyone else knows my password so just to let you know he was disrespecting me
and then deleted my character I never threatened him or abused my powers 
and after deleting my character has not logged back on so he knows he is in the
wrong i have done nothing to him he is just mad because i pissed him off irl
anyways just giving you the whole story

Okay, so ever since I capped Sphain and ate my flakes days ago
he has done small little things that I find to be Harrassment.
Now, that choice is definately up to the Immortals, but figured
I would write a note anyways.  He started out by attacking me
constantly, Dertaherup told him to stop, he did for a little while
and then attacked once.  Now, yesterday, he bought Happy Hour
and it said something like "Kaltez sucks dick for 5 dollars" or
something close to that.  Again today, he bought Happy Hour and
it said "<- Info -> <Happy Hour: Sphain Kaltez is GAY >".  I
think it is a little childish to continue to be mad about a death
or whatever he is mad about.  Thanks.

I have a small question about them.  I had gained 9 Flakes and 1
Piece around 9 hours or so ago.  Now, I didn't gain them all at once,
I just have been saving them.  I had gone to work and when I got home
I logged on and noticed there were some changes added.  When I left
9 hours ago, it was only up to number 355.  And number 358 says that
the Flakes have been Temporarily removed.  Now, my question is:
Can I keep these (9)Flakes/(1)Piece or should I eat those Flakes since
the change wasn't put in until after I had them?  Anyways, I'll be
online for one more hour or so from this note before I get some sleep.
I am hoping that one of you log online so that we can talk about it.
Otherwise, I might log on in the morning before I leave for work.  Only
problem with that is I might not since I've gotta head out for work early.
 
Anyways, either person to person or by replies through note, Thanks for
taking the time to read this.

yes you can decap anyone who is logged in to the mud
whether a connection exists or not. The exception to
this is only when an immortal loads the players file
because then it's imm business.=P If you see someone
kill them. ;)

Your monk Jeal is bugged. Unfortunately so is every
other monk, and technically every other class we have
It's a problem that is only apparent in monks however
as it stems from unarmed combat and nobody does it better
than them. I don't know why the mud crashes beond 
the fact that unarmed combat is involved which is why
the bug still exists.
