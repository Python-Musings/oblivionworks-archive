how is he disrespecting?
do you mean his current title?
 
that's fair enough, crude / offensive tie/decap messages were outlawed
 
i think for titles that yes, we should try and stop it.. BUT
you need to remember that we cater for everyone, and if someone wants
to swear then we can't really prevent it. it's up to the discretion of
the player if they take offense to this.
 
i will post a note on board 3 about the titles, if people continue to
disregard it then you have my blessings to punish them

Subject Niklaren~
Text
suspect Niklaren of cheating
 
reasoning:
1) Niklaren and Mephisto show up under Multiplay watch
2) ploaded Niklaren, who has gen 6, Mephisto who has gen 7
3) Nicholas who has five hours (looks very new so I am assuming
that he quickly typed "commit", and has one pdeath
4) Niklaren has one status
 
I'm assuming that someone had taken Niklaren down to gen7, and he
has done this to get it back
 
I'm unable to confirm if Nicholas has same IP has Niklaren/Mephisto
as it does not show up in finger
 
If you see Nicholas online, check to see if he has the same host
as Niklaren, if he does, nuke his sorry ass
 
I'm going to question him next time I see him, and will most likely
jail him till I can get an explaination

Actually yes there is a lot to discuss, and yet not
much. I just got my internet back tonight, at least for
the moment, but I think it will remain stable now.
So hopefully I'll be online more and you might be able
to catch me on here, if not I will certainly frequent
MSN. I've allready added you, ruinz01 is me. Just send
me a message even if I'm marked away. I always leave
my status away, so you never can really tell=P
