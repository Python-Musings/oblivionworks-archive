Im thinking my monk is bugged Im not sure though
seems when i start going berserk crazy with jeal
and im using nukebuff frequently with him the mud lags out
and actually crashed while i was logged on
dunno if its related or not but I will leave him logged off until 
I am told it is safe to log him back in
thanks
