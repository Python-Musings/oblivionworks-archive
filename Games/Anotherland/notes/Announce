Subject offensive / unecessary messages + titles~
Text
I'd like to advise that if you have an offensive or inappropriate title,
tie message, decap message, enter message or leave message.. you WILL
be asked (and now expected) to change it.
 
Not trying to get all Nazi on everyone, but it's unnecessary.
I'm not against swearing and trash talk, after all this is a mud not
a catholic school.. but try and have a little bit of dignity..
 
And another thing on this topic, if you are requested by an immortal to
alter or refrain from using a particular message.. DO IT. If you have
an issue with the request, or find it unfair, address it appropriatley
by making contact with myself, or the other immortals.
 
Now play nice, and I'll see you all in a few weeks (or months).. =o)
 
- Tal.

Subject Re: changes to bank~
Text
So the bank was lowered yesterday.. and now most of you know about it.
Having spoken to a number of you, I'm a bit concerned about how much
of a friggin pack of sooks you all are...
 
Seriously, if you want a mud where you can max everything in 2 hours
and get everything you want straight away. Fine, there are plenty of
shithouse muds out there, that I'm sure would accomadate your wish.
 
But this constant "logging in, having a cry, logging out" stuff...
Suck it up & get over it.. The Imm's don't want a bunch of spoonfed,
sooky little babies crying about every time something gets lowered.
 
If you have genuine concerns about a change, you can utilise the
personal board, and send a note to the imms with your request, as
long as it is thought out and not just "I don't like this, change it"
crap like we are getting at the moment. If you want us to treat you
like children, we can.

Enough with the bitching about class changes...
 
If you think a class is overpowered, that's fine... we can
and will aim to sort it out.
 
Just because a class has been boosted, or a power has been
made buff, doesn't automatically make that class invincible.
 
Just because someone with a buff skill beats you, doesn't
mean that another class won't just shred him/her to pieces.
Or even perhaps that your class needs tweaking?
 
Many possibilities, not just one "tweak me till my class owns"
little button that Beorn, Chrono or Dert can press and make
things balanced. You have an issue. Make it public. That's the
feedback we want. We don't want one-sided bitching and we
most certainly do not, and will not tolerate, demands on imms
to change things. We are not robots. Learn to deal with it.
 
From now on, any inappropriate outbursts on the boards or on
channels regarding this issue will result in punishment.

Have a merry Christmas, happy Hanakuh(?)! But if you celebrate
kwanza or one of those other HEATHEN holidays...then...
FUCK OFF! Allright just kidding...everyone in general
can fuck off, how's that?=P We're all going to hell anyways.
killing people, even virtually, is still a sin even if it
isn't I know I'm fucked, my hell will be listening to the
list of sins for eternity. Anyways, enjoy the holiday shit
if you can. I'll be on part of next week, internet/weather
permitting.
