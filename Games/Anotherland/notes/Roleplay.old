Text
just read about mccp never heard of it before. it says under the help file it 
is compatable with zmud. As idiotic as this sounds, before i go and download 
i just want to know. Will it work with gmud the same way?

Subject clearstat not working~
Text
I keep getting the "You write in agony as magical energies tear you asunder."
message.  I tried clearstat and it didn't work.  I know
it is from a monk fight where some 9 status guy just touched
me or whatever.  Is there any other way to remove it?
Thanks
Shian
