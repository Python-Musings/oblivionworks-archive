<IMG src="Clutter\Soulgems\SoulGem02.dds" width=68 height=61>This spell is created in which you channel a certain amount of health fatigue and magicka into a Silver Nugget based on what type of Soul Gem you want to create. Petty soul gems take the least amount as Grand Soul Gems take the most.<BR>
*<B>Note</B>: <I>Since there is a quest for the Black Soul gems in which you can use the alter as many times as needed to make more I left them out from the transmute process.</I><p>
